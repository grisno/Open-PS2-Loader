# Important: If your language require some custom glyphs you should provide a corresponding       #
# TTF font file too, as by default OPL only come with "basic latin" codepage.                     #
#                                                                                                 #
# Once the translation is complete, you can submit it to the dev team.                            #
#                                                                                                 #
# To use your custom language into OPL, simply copy your file into your mc?:/OPL folder.          #
# (File must start with the "lang_" prefix and have the ".lng" extension)                         #
#                                                                                                 #
# Last note, don't put too much comments in your file, it will waste space and loading time.      #
# One single comment line on top "name <yourmail@address.com>" should be enough                   #
#                                                                                                 #
# Thanks for your work.                                                                           #
