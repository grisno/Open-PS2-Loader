The goal of LANMAN module is to provide a very minimal TCP/IP stack to 
OPL for in-game use.

Here are some of it's current limitations:
 - SMAP code doesn't use any buffering for transmit.
 - Only receive ARP / TCP (no IP fragments allowed, so care of MTU 
 and TCP MSS) packets, dropping all other packets not matching these
 criterias.
 - The tcp code is ugly, not really TCP and is here just for testing, 
it needs a full rewrite using threads.

And some of its features despite limitations:
 - It doesn't need to allocate some IOP memory for outgoing ethernet
 frames.
